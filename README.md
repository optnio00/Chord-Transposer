# Description
ChordReader is an app that fetches chord charts and tabulatures for your favorite songs from the Internet, saves them, and displays them in an easy-to-read format with the chords highlighted. The identified chords can also be transposed up or down, or you can add a capo. It's good for changing the key of a song to fit your vocal range.
